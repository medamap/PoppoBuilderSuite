# Contributing to PoppoBuilder Suite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PoppoBuilder Suite! This project is unique because it's self-improving - PoppoBuilder can implement features for itself through the dogfooding system.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### The Dogfooding Approach (Recommended)

The easiest way to contribute is through PoppoBuilder's dogfooding functionality:

1. **Create a Feature Request Issue**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "New Feature: Your Feature Name" \
  --body "Detailed description of the feature you'd like to see" \
  --label "task:dogfooding" \
  --repo medamap/PoppoBuilderSuite
```

2. **Let PoppoBuilder Implement It**
PoppoBuilder will automatically:
- Analyze the feature request
- Implement the code
- Update documentation
- Run tests
- Update the project status

3. **Review and Provide Feedback**
- Check the implementation in the issue comments
- Provide feedback or ask for modifications
- Once satisfied, thank PoppoBuilder to mark it complete

### Traditional Contributing

If you prefer manual contribution:

1. **Fork the Repository**
2. **Create a Feature Branch**
3. **Make Your Changes**
4. **Submit a Pull Request**
