## Cleanup Strategy Applied

### Label Corrections
1. **Missing "completed" labels:** Added to issues that have successful completion comments
2. **Conflicting labels:** Removed "processing" from issues that are actually completed
3. **Status consistency:** Ensured label states match actual completion status

### Error Comment Management
1. **Rate limit errors:** Kept first and last occurrence only, removed repetitive middle comments
2. **Process initialization errors:** Same strategy - kept first and last for debugging context
3. **Empty error messages:** Removed all instances
4. **Post-completion errors:** Removed older ones, kept most recent for monitoring

### Preservation Strategy
- **First error of each type:** Preserved for debugging and pattern identification
- **Last error of each type:** Preserved to show final state
- **Completion comments:** All preserved as they contain important implementation details
- **Manual comments:** All preserved as they contain human insights

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Readability:** Issues are now much easier to read and understand
2. **Accurate Status Tracking:** Labels correctly reflect completion status
3. **Reduced Noise:** Eliminated redundant error spam while preserving diagnostic information
4. **Better Navigation:** Completed issues are properly labeled for filtering
5. **Maintained History:** Important completion details and error patterns are preserved

## Tools Created

1. **`cleanup-issue-status.js`:** Analyzes and corrects issue labels and status inconsistencies
2. **`cleanup-error-comments-v2.js`:** Identifies and manages redundant error comments
3. **Summary comments:** Added to issues explaining what error comments were cleaned up

## Repository State After Cleanup

- **Total issues processed:** 45
- **Issues with corrected labels:** 14
- **Issues with error comment cleanup:** 5
- **Redundant comments identified:** 66
- **Status consistency:** ✅ Achieved

The repository now has a much cleaner issue tracker with proper status labels and significantly reduced error comment noise, while maintaining all important diagnostic and completion information.
